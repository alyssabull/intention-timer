## Programming Languages Used

- HTML in `index.html`
- CSS in `styles.css`
- Vanilla JavaScript
  - in `main.js`
  - an Actvity Class in `activity.js`

## Learning Goals

- Building an entire web app from scratch using the three primary Frontend languages.
- Complete 6 iterations that match the provided comp from the project description.
- Working between two different JavaScript files and using a class to structure the Data Model.
- Using Event Delegation and Event Propagation to make features on the application dynamic.
- Utilizing LocalStorage to save Activities and persist on refresh.

## Planning

How we communicated with one another and organized each iteration.

### Challenges

- Timer Clock
  - Connecting the countdown with the data model and understanding how data types can change using `setInterval()`
  - Stopping the timer with `clearInterval()`
- Refactoring for event delegation
  - Accessing  'grandchildren' elements using the `event.target`.
  - Styling blocks of HTML that are inserted via JavaScript.
- Working in a group of three and alternating drivers and navigators.

### Wins

- Using event delegation on all pieces of the web app besides the original form.
- Manipulating a timer clock that aligned both the data model and the DOM.
- Utilizing localStorage to make unique activities persist on page load.
- Added extra functionality that allows users to delete all past activities on button click.
