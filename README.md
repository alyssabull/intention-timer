# Intention Timer Group Project

## Project Description

- Link the rubric and project brief.
- Explain at a high level what the web app does

- [How to access this project](https://github.com/dietza/intention-timer)
- [Deployed Github Page](https://dietza.github.io/intention-timer/)

## Functionality

- Dissect each iteration's functionality
- One Gif of the entire functionality.

## Programming Languages Used

- HTML in `index.html`
- CSS in `styles.css`
- Vanilla JavaScript
  - in `main.js`
  - an Actvity Class in `activity.js`

## Learning Goals

- Building an entire web app from scratch using the three primary Frontend languages
- Working between two different JavaScript files and using a class to structure the Data Model.
- Using Event Delegation and Event Propagation to make features on the application dynamic.
- Utilizing LocalStorage to save Activities and persist on refresh.

## Planning

How we communicated with one another and organized each iteration.

### Challenges

- Timer Clock
  - Connecting the countdown with the data model and understanding how data types can change using `setInterval()`
  - Stopping the timer with `clearInterval()`
- Refactoring for event delegation
  - Accessing  'grandchildren' elements using the `event.target`.
  - Styling blocks of HTML that are inserted via JavaScript.
- Working in a group of three and alternating drivers and navigators.

### Wins

- Using event delegation on all pieces of the web app besides the original form.
- Manipulating a timer clock that aligned both the data model and the DOM.
- Utilizing localStorage to make unique activities persist on page load.
